Requirements: [https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/projects/0/tictactoe/](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/projects/0/tictactoe/)

> The project implements functionality to play Tic Tac Toe against an AI. This is done in the form of a minimax algorithm and is optimised with alpha beta pruning. The pseudocode for these methods are shown below. Unit tests are also written to ensure correct functionality of all implemented functions.
