The project requires the implementation of functionality to play Tic Tac Toe against an AI. This is done in the form of a minimax algorithm and is optomised with alpha beta pruning. The psuedocode for these methods are shown below. Unit tests are also written to ensure correct functionality of all implemented functions.
